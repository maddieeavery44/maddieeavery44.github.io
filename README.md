# GEOG 4046 Final Project

## Photo Map Tour Showing Current Weather
A map showing the locations I made while on two different geological fields trips using GPS coordinates. These geologic locations are shown by markers that the audience can click to display details of the stops I made and a photo. I recorded these coordinates while in the field in my geology field notebook. The website below will display the map along with the geology and topography of the region. My data was taken from March 27 to April 18, 2020.
